# Image-to-Pencil-Sketch
IMAGE TO PENCIL SKETCH USING PYTHON - OpenCV
This project is one of the simplest python project. Image can be converted into Pencil Sketch with just 10 to 12 lines of Codes. So, Just give your hour with a cup of coffee to explore this project.

Abstract :
This project is based on Image Manipulation using Python Library known as OpenCV i.e. Open Computer Vision. OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.

STEPS:
  1) Importing Libraries cv2 & matplotlib.pyplot
  2) Loading Original Image.
  3) Converting BGR into Gray Scale Image.
  4) Inverting Gray Scaled Image.
  5) Bluring Inverted Image.
  6) Inverting Blurred Image.
  7) Generating Pencil Sketch Image.
  8) Saving and loading image.
  9) Visualization  in a Single Frame
